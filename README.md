# coding-samples-and-experiments

This is a small sampling of code that I wrote, extended, ported, or just played around with while volunteering as a CTA for the Fundamentals of Computing specialization on Coursera. These programs are meant to be used with Codeskulptor and can be run using the following links (press the triangle button at top left of associated page to run). In this sampling, there are no course projects, samples of my professional work, or programs written in languages other than Python. This is only to illustrate a basic knowledge of Python and programming (and perhaps an understanding of C/C++ as a few of these are ports of other people's work).

<pre># CodeSkulptor runs Python programs in your browser.
# Click the upper left button to run this simple demo.

# CodeSkulptor runs in Chrome 18+, Firefox 11+, and Safari 6+.
# Some features may work in other browsers, but do not expect
# full functionality.  It does NOT run in Internet Explorer.</pre>
