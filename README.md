# coding-samples-and-experiments

This is a small sampling of code that I wrote, extended, ported, or just played around with while volunteering as a CTA for the Fundamentals of Computing specialization on Coursera. I don't believe that this sampling contains any course-specific code, and it doesn't include samples of my professional work or programs I've written in languages other than Python. This is intended to illustrate a basic knowledge of Python and programming. 

These programs were written for use with Codeskulptor and can be run using the links below (press the triangle button at top left of associated page to run). The arc_parabolic program is probably the cleanest (It was meant to be shared with teenage coders). Many of these were one-off projects for self-improvement or throw-away "doodles" created for fun.

# Click the upper left button to run this simple demo.

# CodeSkulptor runs in Chrome 18+, Firefox 11+, and Safari 6+.
# Some features may work in other browsers, but do not expect
# full functionality.  It does NOT run in Internet Explorer.</pre>
